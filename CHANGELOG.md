# v0.11.7 (Upcoming Release)

- Use `size(x, 1)` and `size(x, 2)` instead of `n, _  = size(x)` and `_, p = size(x)`, respectively.
- Add `v1.11` of Julia in GitHub CI.


# v0.11.6 

- Update citation of `robhatreg` a.k.a Robust Hat Matrix based Regression Estimator
- Fix typos in code, code comments, and documentation
- Replace one dimensional `Array{` definitions with `Vector{`
- Define deviations and their bounds in a single line and remove additional constraints in LAD and Quantile Regression
- Atkinson94 returns `betas` insteada of `coef` in returned dictionary.


# v0.11.5

- Initial implementation of the robust hat matrix regression estimator
- Add more test to robust hat matrix regression estimator
- Introduce `view` in LTS and LMS.


# v0.11.4 

- More explicit return types, drop `Dict` with `Dict{String, Any}` or `Dict{String, Vector}`
- Add `Julia v.1.10` to GitHub actions
- Initial attempt to reduce memory allocations in `lts()`, `lms()`, `hadi92()`, `hadi94()`, `hs93()`, `robcov()`
- Replace `@assert` macro with `throw(ErrorException())` in whole code
- `depestregression` returns `Dict` instead of a `vector` of betas like other regression methods.
- `summary()` throws `ErrorException` rather than simply prompting with `@error` macro.
- `robcov` doesn't use try and catch any more.
- Replace `sortperm` with `sortperm!` in mve.
- Set number of iterations to minimum([5 * p, 3000]) of LTS as in the R implementation. This reduces the time required 3x.

# v0.11.3 

- Minor fixes

# v0.11.2

- Optional eps and maxiter parameters in iterateCSteps() in LTS.
- Replace `ols(X[indices, :], y[indices])` with `X[...] \ y[...]` in highly computational ones such like LTS, LMS, and LTA. 

# v0.11.1

- Concrete types of X and y changed to AbstractMatrix{Float64} and AbstractVector{Float64}
- Change function signatures from ::Function to ::F where {F <: Function}
- Increase test coverage

# v0.11.0

- Deepest Regression Estimator added.


# v0.10.2 

- mahalanobisSquaredBetweenPairs() return Union{Nothing, Matrix} depending on the determinant of the covariance matrix
- mahalanobisSquaredMatrix() returns Union{Nothing, Matrix} depending on the determinant of the covariance matrix
- import in DataImages fixed.
- Array{Float64, 1} is replaced by Vector{Float64}.
- Array{Float64, 2} is replaced by Matrix{Float64}.
- Use of try/catch reduced, many tries were depending on singularities.


# v0.10.1 

- Update compatibility with Clustering and StatsModels


# v0.10.0

- LMS returns betas rather than coefs
- PrecompileTools integration for faster loading of package
- Replace RGB{} to RGBX{} in plots

# v0.9.5 

- Adopt to SnoopPrecompile for better first-time-use experiment
  


#Â v0.9.4

- Convergency check for hs93()
- Add earlystop option for inexact version of lta().
- Remove cga() and cga based experimental algorithm.
- Fix deadlock in bacon.

# v0.9.3

- ga() is now faster.
- Implement dfbetas().
- Separate implementations of dffit() and dffits()
- Implement diagnose()
- Replace GLPK with HiGHS. When n > 10000, HiGHS based lad() is now approximately 6x faster.
- asm2000(), imon2005(), ks89(), bacon(), and smr98() now return regression coefficients calculated using the clean set of observations.
- lts() has a new optional parameter called earlystop and it is true by default. If the objective function does not change in a predefined number of iterations, the search is stopped.
- py95() returns vector of estimated regression coefficients using the clean observations.


# v0.9.2

- Increase test coverage 
- Add ols(setting) and wls(setting, weights = w) type method call where setting is a regression setting 
- Implement cooksoutliers() method for determining potential regression outliers using a cutoff value.
- Update documentation
- Implement Theil-Sen estimator for multiple regression


# v0.9.1

- Fix bchplot dependencies
- Update README with new instructions
- Satman2015 now returns more verbose output


# v0.9.0

- Add exact argument for LAD. If exact is true then the linear programming based exact solution is found. Otherwise, a GA based search is performed to yield approximate solutions. 
- Remove dependency of Plots.jl. If Plots.jl is installed and loaded manually, the functionality that uses Plot is automatically loaded by Requires.jl. Affected functions are `dataimage`, `mveltsplot`, and `bchplot`.


# v0.8.19

- Update Satman(2013) algorithm


# v0.8.18 

- Add docs for Satman's (modified) GA based LTS estimation (2012)



# v0.8.17

- Remove dependency of StatsBase


# v0.8.16

- Quantile Regression implemented


# v0.8.15
